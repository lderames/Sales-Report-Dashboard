# Background

DataSense PH organized the **Zero to Hero Power BI Tutorial** to introduce aspiring data professionals to the core principles of data analytics and visualization using Power BI. As part of this initiative, participants were provided with datasets and tasked with developing dashboards that present actionable insights.
